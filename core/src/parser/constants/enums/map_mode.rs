///
/// For example, suppose the mapping mode is MM_TEXT. Given the following
/// definition of that mapping mode, and an origin (0,0) at the top left corner
/// of the drawing surface, logical coordinate (4,5) would map to physical
/// coordinate (4,5) in pixels.

/// Now suppose the mapping mode is MM_LOENGLISH, with the same origin as the
/// previous example. Given the following definition of that mapping mode,
/// logical coordinate (4,-5) would map to physical coordinate (0.04,0.05) in
/// inches.
